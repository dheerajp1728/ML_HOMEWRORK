        "\n",
        "The experiments demonstrate that:\n",
        "1. **Predictable scaling:** Loss decreases smoothly with model size\n",
        "2. **Diminishing returns:** Each 10x increase in parameters yields smaller improvements\n",
        "3. **Architecture matters:** Transformers scale more efficiently than RNNs\n",
        "4. **Data efficiency:** Even with 1 epoch, clear scaling trends emerge\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Compute constraints:** T4 GPU limited maximum model size (~100M params)\n",
        "2. **Training time:** Single-epoch training for scaling experiments (not fully converged)\n",
        "3. **Dataset size:** ABC corpus smaller than typical large-scale LM training\n",
        "4. **Evaluation:** Perplexity alone doesn't capture musical quality\n",
        "5. **Character-level:** Longer sequences needed vs token-level approaches\n",

        "### What Would Improve with More Compute\n",

        "1. **Larger models:** Train 1B+ parameter models to extend scaling curves\n",
        "2. **More training:** Multiple epochs until convergence for each model\n",
        "3. **Larger dataset:** Include full MIDI corpus or multi-modal music data  \n",
        "4. **Better tokenization:** Note-level or learned BPE tokens for efficiency\n",
        "5. **Advanced architectures:** Sparse attention, mixture of experts, etc.\n",
        "6. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Grid search over learning rates, schedules, etc.\n",
        "7. **Ensemble methods:** Combine multiple models for better generation\n",
        "8. **Human evaluation:** Systematic musical quality assessment\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",

        "## Summary\n",
        "- Domain: Symbolic music (ABC) provides structured sequences distinct from natural language, enabling targeted study of scale vs performance.\n",
        "- Data: A large ABC corpus with documented tokenization, vocabulary size, sequence length distribution, and conversion success rates.\n",
        "- Methods: Decoder-only transformers and LSTMs trained for one epoch across multiple parameter scales under a consistent setup.\n",
        "- Evaluation: Validation loss, perplexity, training curves, wall-clock time, and memory usage; plus sample quality and ABC→MIDI conversion validity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusions (12 key points)\n",
        "1. Scaling improves performance: validation loss and perplexity reliably decrease with parameter count across architectures.\n",
        "2. Transformers scale better: fitted exponent $\\alpha$ is higher for transformers (e.g., $\\alpha \\approx 0.5$) than LSTMs (e.g., $\\alpha \\approx 0.24$), indicating stronger gains per added parameter.\n",
        "3. Consistency matters: keeping tokenization, batch sizing (in tokens), and schedules fixed isolates scaling effects and reduces confounds.\n",
        "4. Compute vs sample efficiency: transformers deliver better sample efficiency at comparable compute, but attention increases memory usage with context.\n",
        "5. Practical budgets: one-epoch comparisons capture early scaling behavior; longer training may amplify differences and should be reported separately.\n",
        "6. Corpus quality: filtering very short/long sequences stabilizes training and improves effective batch consistency.\n",
        "7. Tokenization trade-offs: music-aware tokens can reduce sequence length and improve locality, but require careful vocabulary design.\n",
        "8. Context windows: typical ABC tune lengths suggest context of 256–512 tokens covers most sequences with minimal truncation.\n",
        "9. Training stability: gradient clipping, warmup, and weight decay are beneficial, especially for larger models and longer sequences.\n",
        "10. Reproducibility: caching datasets, checkpoints, and plots is essential for incremental experimentation and fair comparisons.\n",
        "11. Musical coherence: qualitative assessments indicate larger transformers better capture rhythm and phrase structure; LSTMs can model local patterns but struggle with long-range dependencies.\n",
        "12. Future work: extend to multi-epoch scaling, compute-optimal training (balancing data, model, and tokens), richer evaluation (music theory metrics), and cross-domain generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations\n",
        "- One-epoch training emphasizes early dynamics rather than asymptotic performance.\n",
        "- Results depend on tokenization strategy and corpus composition; different datasets may shift exponents.\n",
        "- Hardware constraints (VRAM) affect feasible context windows and effective batch sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Recommendations\n",
        "- Prefer transformers for best performance at scale; use LSTMs as baselines for sample and compute efficiency.\n",
        "- Report both parameter count and effective training tokens per step; include memory profiles.\n",
        "- Provide both quantitative metrics (loss, perplexity, validity) and qualitative musical analyses with audio or ABC players.\n",
