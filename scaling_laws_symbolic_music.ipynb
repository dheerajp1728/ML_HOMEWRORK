    "## 12. Final Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Scaling Law Behavior\n",
    "- **Power Law Confirmed:** Validation loss follows L ∝ N^(-α)\n",
    "- Both Transformers and LSTMs exhibit predictable scaling\n",
    "- Transformers show more efficient scaling than LSTMs (steeper slope)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Comparison\n",
    "- **Transformers** outperform LSTMs at equivalent parameter counts\n",
    "- Attention mechanism provides better long-range dependencies\n",
    "- LSTMs are faster to train but require more parameters for similar performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Generation Quality\n",
    "- Character-level models can learn ABC notation syntax\n",
    "- Prompt conditioning works effectively\n",
    "- Musical structure emerges even with limited training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Scaling Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments demonstrate that:\n",
    "1. **Predictable scaling:** Loss decreases smoothly with model size\n",
    "2. **Diminishing returns:** Each 10x increase in parameters yields smaller improvements\n",
    "3. **Architecture matters:** Transformers scale more efficiently than RNNs\n",
    "4. **Data efficiency:** Even with 1 epoch, clear scaling trends emerge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute constraints:** T4 GPU limited maximum model size (~100M params)\n",
    "2. **Training time:** Single-epoch training for scaling experiments (not fully converged)\n",
    "3. **Dataset size:** ABC corpus smaller than typical large-scale LM training\n",
    "4. **Evaluation:** Perplexity alone doesn't capture musical quality\n",
    "5. **Character-level:** Longer sequences needed vs token-level approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Would Improve with More Compute\n",
    "\n",
    "With additional resources, we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Larger models:** Train 1B+ parameter models to extend scaling curves\n",
    "2. **More training:** Multiple epochs until convergence for each model\n",
    "3. **Larger dataset:** Include full MIDI corpus or multi-modal music data  \n",
    "4. **Better tokenization:** Note-level or learned BPE tokens for efficiency\n",
    "5. **Advanced architectures:** Sparse attention, mixture of experts, etc.\n",
    "6. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Grid search over learning rates, schedules, etc.\n",
    "7. **Ensemble methods:** Combine multiple models for better generation\n",
    "8. **Human evaluation:** Systematic musical quality assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates **neural scaling laws on symbolic music data**, showing that:\n",
    "- Language modeling techniques transfer well to structured symbolic domains\n",
    "- Model scale is a reliable predictor of performance\n",
    "- ABC notation is a viable format for music generation experiments\n",
    "- Colab constraints are manageable with careful model sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaling behavior observed here mirrors findings in NLP (Kaplan et al., 2020), suggesting universal principles in how neural networks learn sequential patterns.\n",
